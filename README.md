This is a tiny script that "still" uses pysimpleguiqt to sit in your tray and change wallpapers, just for you.
Main idea is to grab some fresh and good wallpapers based on your preferences, tags, likes, etc

This script is kind of pre alpha, and if you still wanna use it than
Please, use branch "master" and submit issues

## TODO
making client side more accurate
Add cinnamon, mate, gnome support
Add windows support

rewrite it to GTK3+(maybe)
